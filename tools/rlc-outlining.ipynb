However, Hall sensors are normally used for static magnetic fields any may only be used for low frequency applications (try it out!). One easy and cost effective alternative may be a pickup coil that can be either bought commercially having military reads precision up to some MHz even or I first want to try to wind a simple one on my own and use it to measure the frequency and relative strength of my magnetic field.\n",
